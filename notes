Constants:
acceleration due to gravity
friction coefficient
initial projectile velocity
maximum number of objects

physics.js:
setup physics config

objects.js + geometries.js:
create object function (prisms, spheres, cones, etc)
  mass, halfExtents, position, quaternion, material
create rigid body function
create debris function
remove debris function
is projectile a special object? it shouldn't be

materials.js:
materials (lighting model, colour, texture)

dynamics.js:
step function
step world
update rigid bodies
  update position, quaternion, collided status (isCollided)
update manifolds?
  update data, breakable and collided
  get contacts?
    calculate impulse
  apply fracture
  get debris
    apply velocity and angular velocity to fragments
  get objects
    apply velocity and angular velocity to fragments
  remove exceeded debris

onWindowResize + other event listeners
animate and render functions

Demo:
Inertia (no dest.) (high mass objects, low mass objects)
Dominoes (no dest.) (loops for straights and curves)
Shooting stuff (highly destructible environment with stacked objects)
